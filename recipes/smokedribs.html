    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spare Ribs cut and trimmed to preferred style.</li>
        <li>Rub, marinade, or seasoning of choice.</li>
        <li>Barbacue sauce, dry spices of choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>If marinading the ribs, soak in the marinade of choice for six to twelve hours before cooking in a large cassarole dish with a cover or plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>If using a rub, apply rub or seasoning to the ribs on both sides, enough to have good coverage but not so thick that smoke cannot penetrate.</li>
        <li>On a smoker, get the heat with the wood of your choice up to 200 degrees fahrenheit. Allow smoker to clear out of white or 'dirty' smoke.</li>
        <li>Once the smoker is clear, put the ribs off direct heat bone-side down on the smoker.</li>
        <li>Allow ribs to smoke until around 180 degrees fahrenheit as measured at the center of the meat by a thermometer, est. three to four hours.</li>
        <li>Once ribs have reached 180, increase the heat of the smoker up to 225-250 degrees fahrenheit. Check temperature regularly.</li>
        <li>When the ribs reach 197-201 degrees fahrenheit, remove from the smoker. Wrap in foil or place in a cooler used for the purpose and allow to rest for thirty minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with your choice of barbacue sauce or spices.</li>
    </ol>
