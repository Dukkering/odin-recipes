    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked short white rice</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>4 rolls of sushi seaweed (nori)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>5 tbsp mirin or rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Meat / toppings of your choice (ex. 100g of smoked salmon, 1 cucumber sliced lengthwise, chopped green onion, & cream cheese)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, Wasabi, and Pickled Ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook rice in water until it boils. Cover and simmer until grains are soft, roughly 30 minutes for 1 cup. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
        <li>While rice is cooking, cut your fillings into strips or chop it into pieces as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Mix sugar and vinegar or mirin.</li>
        <li>Slowly cool the rice without drying it out by turning it by hand while fanning it lightly. Take care not to crush the rice.</li>
        <li>Upon the rice being cool enough to touch, mix in the sugar mixture and work it through the rice carefully. When not in use, keep the rice covered with a damp cool cloth.</li>
        <li>On your sushi bamboo mat, spread out a piece of nori. For easier clean-up, cover the bamboo mat with plastic wrap first.</li>
        <li>Cover the nori with a thin layer of rice, leaving the top 2cm uncovered.</li>
        <li>Lay out your choice of fillings horizontally in strips; For an easier time, make a small depression in the line first. Be careful not to overfill,</li>
        <li>Using the mat, roll the sushi in on itself firmly up to near the top.</li>
        <li>Wet the exposed top of the nori, and roll it up with the rest; The wet nori will glue to the rest of the roll with some pressure.</li>
        <li>Using a wet knife, cut the sushi roll into slices of your preferred thickness.</li>
        <li>Serve with soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi on the side as preferred.</li>
    </ol>
